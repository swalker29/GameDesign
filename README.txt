Compilation and Running instructions (same as the Pong assignment). 

Three environment variables need to be set:
export CMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/SFML/share/SFML/cmake/Modules
export LIB=/SFML/lib
export INCLUDE=/SFML/include


No external libraries besides SFML are required. Everything else is included.
The executable that will be generated is "game" so run with ./game

**PREREQUISITES**

- CMAKE (www.cmake.org)
- SFML 2.3.1 (www.sfml-dev.org)


**COMPILE**

Run 'cmake .' to generate the Makefile.  If SFML is not installed in a standard search path, then CMake will not be able to find the required cmake module 'FindSFML.cmake'.  You can direct CMake to look for it in a specific location by setting the environment varibale 'CMAKE_MODULE_PATH'. For example assuming bash and SFML installed in ~/local

export CMAKE_MODULE_PATH=~/local/share/SFML/cmake/Modules
cmake .

To compile, simply run 'make'. If SFML was installed correctly, a executable 'helloworld' will be generated.


**CLEANING UP**

If you want to remove all compiled files, just run 'make clean'.  This will remove every .o file and executable.  It will not however remove any of the files generated by CMake.
If you want to obtain a completely clean copy of your code, you can run the provided script (linux only): 'scripts/cmake_cleanup'

-----------------------

**Controls**

The default controls consist of:
Movement - up/down/left/right
Aim - mouse
Fire - left mouse button
Switch weapons - ',' and '.' for previous and next weapon respectively
Select menu item - enter
Menu selection - up/down
